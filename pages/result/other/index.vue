    <p>Although only around 60 to 80 living tree species are known to be native to the UK, it is generally accepted that there are as many as 60,000 to 100,000 species of tree worldwide.</p>
    <p>Over the last few hundred years, several thousand non-native species have been introduced by plant hunters and collectors to gardens, parks and arboreta across the UK. Many of these introduced species have since become naturalised and have gone on to spread beyond these cultivated areas without further human assistance.</p>
    <p>This means that it is entirely possible that you are trying to identify a tree that is not included in this guide.</p>
