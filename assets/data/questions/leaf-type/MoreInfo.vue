      What do these different options mean?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Simple leaves</strong> appear singly on the stalk, and have a continuous outline without appearing noticeably lobed (although the 'margin' around the edge of many simple leaves is often serrated or contoured).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lobed leaves</strong> are noticeably split into a number of separate protrusions, although the indentations do not reach all the way to the midrib of the leaf - the leaf clearly has one continuous shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        The blades of <strong>compound leaves</strong> are split into a number of separate individual leaflets branching off from a central stalk, or 'petiole', that emerges from a bud on the twig or stem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some other trees - including many evergreens such as fir or pine trees that do not shed their leaves each year - have foilage that resembles long, thin <strong>needles</strong>, or overlapping <strong>scales</strong>, rather than broad leaves with a stalk.
      </li>
    </ul>
